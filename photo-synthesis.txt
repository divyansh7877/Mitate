Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy—usually from the sun—into chemical energy stored in glucose. Using chlorophyll, they take in carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air and water (H₂O) from the soil, and with sunlight as an energy source, they produce glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and release oxygen (O₂) as a byproduct. The overall reaction is:

6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂.
